Complete rebuild of what this will actually be, multiple false starts so far. Pondering, seeking info.
Complete rebuild of world constraint.


Inflateable dancing couch with fully exposed poiyomi menu. 
Mostly done, need to add vormoi andimations and fix the world constraint.


FRog car, i finally can replicate the effects i was unable to figure out initially. The car is a free 3d asset on sketchfab but i will need to use some Unity built in tools to recreate the billboard effect. Finally have the software and the knowledge to implate the FINALIK grounder, the shader only rotating effect is now possible in poyomi as well as multiple other phyiscs effects that i had previously overlooked until i was rereading the SDK the other day for the couch.
